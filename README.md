# 🎨 Color Picker Project

This is a simple **Color Picker** web component built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
It marks one more step in my development journey — from static layouts to interactive UI elements.

## 🧠 About the Project  
The Color Picker allows users to select a color and instantly see the result (for example, background‑color change, or value output).  
I created this on my own idea to gain hands‑on experience with user interaction, CSS custom properties, and dynamic updates in JavaScript.

Key practices in this project:
- Building a UI widget with its own logic  
- Applying CSS variables/custom properties for live styling  
- Handling user input and reflecting changes dynamically  
- Ensuring a clean and responsive layout of the component

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML5** – for markup  
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout (including CSS variables)  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** – for interaction logic  

---

## ✨ Features  
- Interactive color picker (hue/saturation slider or input field)  
- Real‑time update of an element’s color based on selection  
- Usage of CSS custom properties to control colors  
- Responsive design: works on desktop and mobile  
- Clean, minimal UI

## 💡 What I Learned  
- How to integrate CSS variables and update them via JS  
- How to build an interactive UI component from scratch  
- How to respond to user input (e.g., slider, input field) and link it to visual changes  
- How to combine styles + logic in a cohesive small project
